# Polymorphic
---
The `Text` component is a polymorphic component. This means that it can be used as a span, a heading or any html element. You can use the `as` prop to change the underlying html element.

<View direction="column">
  <Text as="h1">Heading 1</Text>
  <Text as="h2">Heading 2</Text>
  <Text as="h3">Heading 3</Text>
  <Text as="h4">Heading 4</Text>
  <Text as="h5">Heading 5</Text>
  <Text as="h6">Heading 6</Text>
  <Text as="p">Paragraph</Text>
  <Text as="span">Span</Text>
  <Text as="a" href="#polymorphic">Anchor</Text>
  <Text as="label">Label</Text>
</View>

```tsx
<View>
  <Text as="h1">Heading 1</Text>
  <Text as="h2">Heading 2</Text>
  <Text as="h3">Heading 3</Text>
  <Text as="h4">Heading 4</Text>
  <Text as="h5">Heading 5</Text>
  <Text as="h6">Heading 6</Text>
  <Text as="p">Paragraph</Text>
  <Text as="span">Span</Text>
  <Text as="a" href="#">Anchor</Text>
  <Text as="label">Label</Text>
</View>
```

# Ref
---
The `Text` component supports the `ref` prop, which allows for obtaining a reference to the associated underlying HTML element. By default the `ref` will be of type `HTMLSpanElement`, but you can use the `as` prop to change the underlying html element.

```tsx
import { useRef } from 'react';
import { Text } from '@rewind-ui/core';

function App() {
  const ref = useRef<HTMLSpanElement>(null);
  return <Text ref={ref}>Hello world!</Text>;
}
```
