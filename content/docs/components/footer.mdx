description: Use the footer component at the end of your page to show content such as sitemap links, brand logo, social icons and more using React and Tailwind CSS
---

The footer component is an important section of a website where you should provide content such as sitemap links, copyright text, logo of your brand, social media account links, and more.

Get started with the examples from Flowbite React based on multiple styles, sizes, and colors by using React components and the utility classes from Tailwind CSS.

To start using the footer component you need to import it from `flowbite-react`:

```jsx
import { Footer } from 'flowbite-react';
```

## Default footer

Use this example to create a simple and responsive footer component with copyright text and links by adding the `<Footer.Copyright>` and `<Footer.Link>` items inside the `<Footer>` component.

Use the `href` prop to add a link to the footer link item and the `year` prop to add the current year.

<Example name="footer.root" />

## Footer with logo

Use the `<Footer.Brand>` component to add a logo to the footer component.

<Example name="footer.withLogo" />

## Social media icons

Feature social media accounts by adding the `<Footer.Icon>` component inside the `<Footer>` component.

<Example name="footer.socialMediaIcons" />

## Sitemap links

Add sitemap links to the footer component by using the `<Footer.LinkGroup>` and `<Footer.Link>` components. You can also use the `<Footer.Title>` component to add a title to the sitemap links and group links together.

<Example name="footer.sitemapLinks" />
