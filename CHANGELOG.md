### [0.4.1](https://github.com/themesberg/flowbite-react/compare/v0.3.8...v0.4.1) (2023-03-03)

### ⚠ BREAKING CHANGES

- **/lib/components/flowbite:** ThemeProps no longer includes usePreferences
- **theme:** Like in #500, this version permanently changes the `FlowbiteTheme` for numerous
  components.

The philosophy is that themes will more clearly reflect the component's structure.

For example, an `<Accordion>` can contain any number of `<Accordion.Title>` or `<Accordion.Content>`
sections. The theme used to look like:

```js
accordion: {
  base: "..",
  content: "..",
  flush: "..",
  title: "..",
}
```

And now, the theme for an `<Accordion>` looks like:

```
js
accordion: {
  root: {
    base: "..",
    flush: "..",
  },
  content: "..",
  title: "..",
}
```

So now the options in the theme which apply to the `<Accordion>` itself will always be found under
`root`. Likewise, `<Accordion.Content>` can be themed via the `content` subsection.

This ultimately will apply to all components.
